## Editor

This is a lightweight online [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) editor with [<img src="http://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%5CLaTeX%20" alt="\LaTeX " />](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) support.  You can try a live version on the [<img src="http://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%5Cmu%20r%5E2" alt="\mu r^2" /> project webpage](http://mur2.co.uk/editor). 

The aim is an editor which can be used to write structural documents which able to handle LaTeX math formula and endnotes. Also, one which can be used to generate other output: pdf, LaTeX and direct export to different blog engines. So far the [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) export is supported with cookies.

We tried to make a minimalist design which helps to concentrate on the writing:

However, if you want you can use more more rich visualisation. On the left top side, click on the ![kep](http://mur2.co.uk/_uploads/photos/attila/mur2_toolbar_bottom.png),  you can open up the editor toolbar:

![<img src="http://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%20%5Cmu%20r%5E2%20" alt=" \mu r^2 " /> toolbar](http://mur2.co.uk/_uploads/photos/attila/mur2_toolbar.png)

Here you can switch in live preview and Markdown syntax highlighting also:

You can save your work locally on a different format and also it is possible to export directly in a Wordpress.com. 

The core of the editor is written in Javascript and based on Roman Parpalak's [Upmath](https://upmath.me/) code, however, as you can see we add plenty of new functionality. As it is Javascript it is working on the client-side mainly, the only exception is the <img src="http://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%5CLaTeX%20" alt="\LaTeX " /> rendering, which is happening on Parpalak [iUpmath](https://i.upmath.me/) server.<a href="#myfootnotea_ka8k8" name="myfootnotes_ka8k8"><sup>1</sup></a>
