### Why Markdown?
Markdown uses a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing easier. The philosophy behind it; a document should be readable without tags everywhere but still be able to add text modifiers such as lists, bold text and italics quickly. It's an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors.^[Like Microsoft Word, Apple’s Pages or Google Docs]

Here’s a quick example of how to emphasize words with Markdown, you simply enclose them in * (asterisks). So, \*emphasize word* would look like *emphasize word* in the final document.

Reasons to try Markdown:

+ It's very simple to learn; the syntax is so simple one can barely call it "_syntax_"
+ It’s fast; the simple formatting saves a significant amount of time over an ordinary word processor or "WYSIWYG" editor.
+ It’s portable; your documents are cross-platform by nature. You can edit them in any text-capable application and on any operating system. Transporting files requires no zip compression or archiving, and the file size is already as small as it can possibly be.

We also help if you are new to markdown or can't remember any of the syntaxes. You can use the toolbar controls within the editor or open up the Markdown cheatsheet in the menu.

### Why Javascript?
There is usually a tradeoff between security and usability with two general approaches:

+ The data in digital publications are stored on a remote server and delivered over the internet via a web browser. Is this secure? At μr² we say that it isn't and we are not just referring to 'man-in-the-middle' attacks. If your provider goes offline, all of your work will be lost. It is useable?  Yes, you can access your data from anywhere with an internet connection.
+ Download and install the platform locally. It is secure? Yes, it is definitely more secure than the previous option, however, you need to install the platform on every device.

Using Javascript helps μr² to better answer these questions. The editor can only be accessed via HTTPS (secure communication over a computer network) from anywhere with an internet connection, so you do not need to install anything. However, the big difference is that your work is stored locally.

### Academic writing
We aim to support academic quality writing which is a huge task that very few publication platforms offer.  We support LaTeX type mathematical input, footnotes, crossreference and equation numbering to name a few.

### Publishing
